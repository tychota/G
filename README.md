# G

G is a Go engine.

It is based on the Book https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-and-the-game-of-go and for now the code 
mostly follow https://github.com/maxpumperla/deep_learning_and_the_game_of_go, licenced under MIT.

## Goal

The Goal of G is to learn more about how to implement a Go engine, like Alpha Go.

Performance is not the primary goal (if you want a good go engine go see https://github.com/gcp/leela-zero).
When I will estimate that I learned enough, I may rewrite the engine in Rust and use GPU optimized library for ML.

## Run it


```python
python3 ./play.py
```
